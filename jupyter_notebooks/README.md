This folder contains the jupyter notebooks used to carry out the majority of my data analysis for published works

Na2+_Ar was used for https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02515

egap_fluctuations was used to create figure 1 of the solvent environments paper
egap_structure_profile was used to create gaussian fits shown in the solvent environments paper and was also used to explore how
  the solvent environments change with Na--Na distance
egap_structure_profile2 collects the statistical measures of egap_structure_profile and creates figures 3 and 4 of the solvent environments paper

Na2(THF)+_clusters and Na2(THF)+_clusters2 were used to look at the (4,5) and (5,5) gas phase trajectories mentioned in the photoisomerization paper
  Na2(THF)+_clusters looks at individual trajectories to get a general sense of the behavior
  Na2(THF)+_clusters2 takes lessons of other notebook and creates ensemble averages, which were used in the publication
Na2(THF)+_liq and Na2(THF)+_liq2_Sr were used to look at (4,5) and (5,5) dissociation in liquid THF
  Na2(THF)+_liq looks at individual trajectories to get a general sense of the behavior
  Na2(THF)+_liq2_Sr creates ensemble averages, which were used in the publication
